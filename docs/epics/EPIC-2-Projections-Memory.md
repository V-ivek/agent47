# Epic 2 – Projections & Memory Governance

## Goal
Transform raw events into deterministic, governed read models.

## Scope
- Memory buckets (global/workspace/ephemeral)
- Promotion & retraction rules
- Projection engine
- Replay support

## Deliverables
- Memory projection tables
- Optional Markdown outputs (MEMORY.md, EPHEMERAL.md)
- Replay CLI for a workspace

## Success Criteria
- Replay reproduces identical projections
- Memory promotion rules are enforced consistently
- Audit trail preserved for all changes

## Out of Scope
- Semantic/vector search
